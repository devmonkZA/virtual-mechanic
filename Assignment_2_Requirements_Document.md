http://virtual-mechanic.googlecode.com/files/asd.JPG

The "Virtual Mechanic" app for iPhone is a teaching tool that allows users to learn about how things work by virtually dissecting machines on the device's touchscreen. The developers of the program will provide content by creating various virtual machines for users to play with. For each machine, the user is basically presented with many layered images that can be selected and dragged around to reveal other images below and around them.

When presented with a machine, users can click and drag parts of the machine around on the screen so that it feels like the user is actually dismantling the machine. Users can find out more about what each part does by reading the part description, viewing other people's comments, and seeing relevant photos.

Users can contribute to the overall discussion by posting photos that are taken by the iPhone. They can also post comments on a specific part of the machine or the machine in general.

The title bar is displayed at the very top of the screen and contains:</li></ul>

<a href='http://i875.photobucket.com/albums/ab318/greg1337Steff/Tutorial%20Photos/THeTitleBar.jpg?t=1255029726'>http://i875.photobucket.com/albums/ab318/greg1337Steff/Tutorial%20Photos/THeTitleBar.jpg?t=1255029726</a>

<ul><li>Back Button<br>
To the far left, clicking on this button always goes back to the previous page/view.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Selected status<br>
In the center the name of the current object selected, if no object is selected it will display "Selected now: Overall".</li></ul>

<ul><li>Help Button<br>
The help button which appears on all windows brings up a menu which gives the user an option to browse the user manual, search for a topic in the manual, or to report a bug. Clicking on the help button again or clicking on "Back" returns to the previous screen.</li></ul>

<h3>The Control Bar</h3>
The control bar is present whenever the user is viewing a machine.  It is displayed at the bottom of the screen and contains 4 clickable buttons:<br>
<br>
<a href='http://i875.photobucket.com/albums/ab318/greg1337Steff/TheControlBar.jpg?t=1255027176'>http://i875.photobucket.com/albums/ab318/greg1337Steff/TheControlBar.jpg?t=1255027176</a>

<ul><li>Undo - Undo previous drag and drop action. I.e. Undoes the last manipulation of the Machine. That is it will return the most recently moved part to its last position.<br>
</li><li>Details and Discuss - Brings up a screen which shows the details and comments of a particular part (when a part is selected) or the machine in general. Has an option to allow users to add a comment. If this screen is already open, clicking it closes the comment window (returning the machine view). Each Comment will contain the following information:  Posters name, date posted, and the comment itself.  The first comment will always be a detailed description of the part/machine. This description will be made by the machine designer. The rest of the comments are user-created and will be updated from the central server and displayed. If no internet connection is found, then new posts will not be uploaded or downloaded.<br>
</li><li>Photos - The button brings up a photo album with relevant photos for the currently selected part. If no part is selected then it brings up a photo album with relevant photos of the overall machine. Clicking on a photo expands the photo to the size of the screen. Zooming in and out of the photo is done by placing two fingers on the screen and separating and pinching the fingers. Dragging a single finger around moves the image around on the screen. There is an option to upload a picture from the iPhone's library or to take a new photo. Clicking on this button shows a menu where the user can select the source of photo. After uploading a photo, the photo appears in the library.<br>
</li><li>Reset Button - The reset button returns all the parts of the machine to their original default location. This feature can be supplemented turning on the "Shake to reset" option under "Settings"</li></ul>

<h2>Available actions while in the Machine View</h2>
The Machine view is the screen where the user may view and interact with the machine. It is here that the user may dissasemble the Machine or perform other actions.<br>
<br>
<h3>Disassembly</h3>
<ul><li>By using their fingers, users can take a machine, apart piece by piece. Using a "click-and-drag" interface, users can place the pieces anywhere they wish on the screen. Since the machine is built with many overlapping images, users can view the deeper components by dragging the upper images to other places on the screen.  <br>
</li><li>In addition to viewing the deeper image, users can drag to zoom to a specific component they want to look at in detail.</li></ul>

<ul><li>To select a part: The user taps the part with their finger.  The name of the part is displayed at the top of the screen to show that the correct part has been selected. The selected part is highlighted with a glowing red 'halo' around it.</li></ul>

<ul><li>To deselect a part:  The user taps on an empty space somewhere on the screen. The red 'halo' disappears and the title bar updates to show that the overall machine is now selected. If the user taps on a different part, then the halo disappears from the old part and appears on the new one. The title bar, as usual, reflects this change as well.</li></ul>

<ul><li>To move a part:  Once the part is selected the user may press and move their finger around to simulate a dragging action. The part is dragged to the desired location, and releasing the finger stops the dragging motion.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Zooming: Using two fingers to tap and expand on the screen will zoom in to the machine. To be more precisely, the screen will start zooming in from the place where the two fingers tapped at beginning. So the users can decide where to zoom in. When looking at photos, the action zooms into/out of photos.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Usage of buttons on the control bar, already described above.</li></ul>
