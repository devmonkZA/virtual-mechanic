2.  System Diagrams This should include 2 or 3 (or more, if needed) substantial
diagrams showing how the major modules, classes, and functions of your system
relate and share data. Important: these must be diagrams as described in chapter 8
(System models) of the textbook; you must follow the proper rules and notations for
the diagrams you use. It is not acceptable to make up your own kind of diagram! If
you are using an object-oriented programming language, than one of your diagrams
ought to be a class diagram.
Keep in mind the purpose of this is not just to draw pretty diagrams, but to create
blue prints that will later on help you implement your system.
