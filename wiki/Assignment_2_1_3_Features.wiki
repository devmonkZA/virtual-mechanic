===Download new Machines===
Allows the user to download new machines from the server

A button in the main menu opens up a catalog of machines available for download. *(we may not want to implement this one in any of our versions as it would mean we would need more than the one machine to 'take apart')*

Shake-to-randomize: on/off (mixes up the part positions)<br>

==Viewing the Machine==
===The Control Bar===
The control bar is present whenever the user is viewing a machine.  It is displayed at the bottom of the screen and contains 5 buttons:
====Reset====
The reset button returns all the parts of the machine to their default location

====Commenting====
The commenting button allows users bring up the comment window for the currently selected part.  

If no part is selected it brings up the comment window for the machine.

If the comment window is already open it closes the comment window (returning the view of the device)

====Photo uploading/Viewing====
The Photo button brings up the photo window for the currently selected part.  If no part is selected then it brings up a photo window for the machine.

====Help====
The Help button brings up the help window

====Main Menu====
Returns the user to the main menu
-------------------------------------------------------------------
===Manipulating the Device===
====Disassembly====
By using their fingers, users can take a machine, apart piece by piece. Using a "click-and-drag" interface, users can place the pieces anywhere they wish on the screen. Since the machine is build by many overlapping images, Users can view the deeper components by dragging the upper images to other place. *(<= Needs clarification)* <br> In addition to viewing the deeper image, users can drag to zoom specific component they want to look at in detail.

To select a part: The user taps the layer with their finger.  The name of the part is displayed at the top of the screen to show that the correct part has been selected.

To deselect a part:  The user may tap empty space.

To move a part:  Once the part is selected the user may press and hold their finger over the layer and then drag the layer to the desired location.

====Zooming====
Using two fingers to tap and expand on the screen will zoom in to the machine. To be more precisely, the screen will start zooming in from the place where the two fingers tapped at beginning. So the users can decide where to zoom in. When looking at photos, the action zooms into/out of photos. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------
===The comments page===  
The comments page replaces the view of the machine leaving visible the control bar and the name of the part at the top of the screen.  The comments page will display 10 comments per page, with the option to skip pages at the foot of each page.
====Close Comments====
The user will be able to close the comments page by clicking an X in the top right hand corner.
====Post Reply====
The option to post a rely will be given after the last post on that part, by a buttton "reply" to the left of the current page indicator.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
==Search==
A button in the main menu links to a search page. Here, users can type the key word in search engine to search for a part which will show on the screen in Iphone and find part descriptions, comments from others, photos, etc.

==Game mode?==
Assemble a "broken" machine back together in the shortest time. Record time taken and upload time to an online scoreboard. <-- (I think this is outside of the scope of the project and would be too much work for what it brings to the table (Greg))
