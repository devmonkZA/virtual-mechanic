====Commenting====

If no part is selected it brings up the comment window for the machine.

====Main Menu====

-------------------------------------------------------------------
===The Machine view===
The Machine view is the screen where the user may view and interact with the machine.
====Disassembly====
By using their fingers, users can take a machine, apart piece by piece. Using a "click-and-drag" interface, users can place the pieces anywhere they wish on the screen. Since the machine is built with many overlapping images, users can view the deeper components by dragging the upper images to other places on the screen.  <br> 
In addition to viewing the deeper image, users can drag to zoom to a specific component they want to look at in detail.

To select a part: The user taps the *layer* with their finger.  The name of the part is displayed at the top of the screen to show that the correct part has been selected.

To deselect a part:  The user may tap empty space.

To move a part:  Once the part is selected the user may press and hold their finger over the layer and then drag the layer to the desired location.

====Zooming====
Using two fingers to tap and expand on the screen will zoom in to the machine. To be more precisely, the screen will start zooming in from the place where the two fingers tapped at beginning. So the users can decide where to zoom in. When looking at photos, the action zooms into/out of photos. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------
===The comments page===  
The comments page replaces the view of the machine leaving visible the control bar and the name of the part at the top of the screen.  The comments page will display 10 comments per page, with the option to skip pages at the foot of each page.
====Close Comments====
The user will be able to close the comments page by clicking an X in the top right hand corner.
====Post Reply====
The option to post a rely will be given after the last post on that part, by a buttton "reply" to the left of the current page indicator.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
==Search==
A button in the main menu links to a search page. Here, users can type the key word in search engine to search for a part which will show on the screen in Iphone and find part descriptions, comments from others, photos, etc.
