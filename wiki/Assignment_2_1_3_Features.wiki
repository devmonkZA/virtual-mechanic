==Disassembly==
By using their fingers, users can take a machine, apart piece by piece. Using a "click-and-drag" interface, users can place the pieces anywhere they wish on the screen. Since the machine is build by many overlapping images, Users can view the deeper components by dragging the upper images to other place. *(<= Needs clarification)* <br> In addition to viewing the deeper image, users can drag to zoom specific component they want to look at in detail.

To select a part: The user taps the layer with their finger.  The name of the part is displayed at the top of the screen to show that the correct part has been selected.

To deselect a part:  The user may tap empty space.

To move a part:  Once the part is selected the user may press and hold their finger over the layer and then drag the layer to the desired location.




==Zooming==
Using two fingers to tap and expand on the screen will zoom in to the machine. To be more precisely, the screen will start zooming in from the place where the two fingers tapped at beginning. So the users can decide where to zoom in. When looking at photos, the action zooms into/out of photos. 

==Download new machines==
A button in the main menu opens up a catalog of machines available for download. *(we may not want to implement this one in any of our versions as it would mean we would need more than the one machine to 'take apart')*

==Search==
A button in the main menu links to a search page. Here, users can type the key word in search engine to search for a part which will show on the screen in Iphone and find part descriptions, comments from others, photos, etc.



==Program feedback==
A button in the main menu links to a form that allows users to give feedback on the application. 

==Game mode?==
