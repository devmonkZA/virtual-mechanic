#summary Deadlines for internal testing for each version.

2.  The internal deadlines your group sets for unit/system testing of the code for release.
Naturally, these deadlines must be well enough before the project submission date to
give you time to do the testing and fix errors that might arise, but also late enough so
that the development group has time to get all the features implemented.
