The "Virtual Mechanic" app for iPhone is a teaching tool that allows users to learn about how things work by virtually dissecting machines on the device's touchscreen. The developers of the program will provide content by creating various virtual machines for users to play with. For each machine, the user is basically presented with many layered images that can be selected and dragged around to reveal other images below and around them.

When presented with a machine, users can click and drag parts of the machine around on the screen so that it feels like the user is actually dismantling the machine. Users can find out more about what each part does by reading the part description, viewing other people's comments, and seeing relevant photos.

Users can contribute to the overall discussion by posting photos that are taken by the iPhone. They can also post comments on a specific part of the machine or the machine in general.

The application is quite general and may apply to almost any sort of mechanical device one can imagine: Computers, cars, boats, clocks, etc. The user groups are expected to have particular interest in performing their learning in a social setting. Users require no more than a basic understanding of how to operate an iPhone. The groups may be categorized as follows:

- Students learning about mechanical devices. <br>
- People working in the field maintaining mechanical devices. <br>
- People interested in developing mechanical devices. <br>
- People who enjoy learning about mechanical devices as a hobby. <br>

==User Requirements==

- The application is completely visual and thus is unavailable to the visually-impaired. <br>
- The users must have access to an iPhone, iTunes with internet access. <br>
- In order to view comments, or download new content the user must have access to the internet. <br>

  *  Undo - Undo previous drag and drop action
  *  Details and Discuss - Brings up a screen which shows the details and comments of a particular part (when a part is selected) or the machine in general. Has an option to allow users to add a comment. If this screen is already open, clicking it closes the comment window (returning the machine view)

  *  Reset Button - The reset button returns all the parts of the machine to their original default location. This feature can be supplemented turning on the "Shake to reset" option under "Settings"


===Help Button===
The help button which appears on all windows brings up a menu which gives the user an option to browse the user manual, search for a topic in the manual, or to report a bug. Clicking on the help button again or clicking on "Back" returns to the previous screen.

===Back Buttom===
Clicking on this button always goes back to the previous page/view. 

==Available actions while in the Machine View==
The Machine view is the screen where the user may view and interact with the machine.

===Disassembly===
  *  By using their fingers, users can take a machine, apart piece by piece. Using a "click-and-drag" interface, users can place the pieces anywhere they wish on the screen. Since the machine is built with many overlapping images, users can view the deeper components by dragging the upper images to other places on the screen.  <br> 
  *  In addition to viewing the deeper image, users can drag to zoom to a specific component they want to look at in detail.

  *  To select a part: The user taps the part with their finger.  The name of the part is displayed at the top of the screen to show that the correct part has been selected. The selected part is highlighted with a glowing red 'halo' around it.

  *  To deselect a part:  The user taps on an empty space somewhere on the screen. The red 'halo' disappears and the title bar updates to show that the overall machine is now selected. If the user taps on a different part, then the halo disappears from the old part and appears on the new one. The title bar, as usual, reflects this change as well. 

  *  To move a part:  Once the part is selected the user may press and move their finger around to simulate a dragging action. The part is dragged to the desired location, and releasing the finger stops the dragging motion. 

  *  Zooming
Using two fingers to tap and expand on the screen will zoom in to the machine. To be more precisely, the screen will start zooming in from the place where the two fingers tapped at beginning. So the users can decide where to zoom in. When looking at photos, the action zooms into/out of photos.
