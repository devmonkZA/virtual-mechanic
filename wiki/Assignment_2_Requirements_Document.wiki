The "Virtual Mechanic" app for iPhone is a teaching tool that allows users to learn about how things work by virtually dissecting machines on the device's touchscreen. The developers of the program will provide content by creating various virtual machines for users to play with. For each machine, the user is basically presented with many layered images that can be selected and dragged around to reveal other images below and around them.

When presented with a machine, users can click and drag parts of the machine around on the screen so that it feels like the user is actually dismantling the machine. Users can find out more about what each part does by reading the part description, viewing other people's comments, and seeing relevant photos.

Users can contribute to the overall discussion by posting photos that are taken by the iPhone. They can also post comments on a specific part of the machine or the machine in general.

=Intended Audience=

==User Groups==
The application is quite general and may apply to almost any sort of mechanical device one can imagine: Computers, cars, boats, clocks, etc. The user groups are expected to have particular interest in performing their learning in a social setting. Users require no more than a basic understanding of how to operate an iPhone. The groups may be categorized as follows:

- Students learning about mechanical devices. <br>
- People working in the field maintaining mechanical devices. <br>
- People interested in developing mechanical devices. <br>
- People who enjoy learning about mechanical devices as a hobby. <br>

==User Requirements==

- The application is completely visual and thus is unavailable to the visually-impaired. <br>
- The users must have access to an iPhone, iTunes with internet access. <br>
- In order to view comments, or download new content the user must have access to the internet. <br>
- Because the application is so heavily text based the user should also have an intermediate understanding of the English language. <br>

==Machine View==
===The Interface===
http://i875.photobucket.com/albums/ab318/greg1337Steff/Tutorial%20Photos/TheMachineView.jpg?t=1255029587
===The Title Bar===
The title bar is displayed at the very top of the screen and contains:

http://i875.photobucket.com/albums/ab318/greg1337Steff/Tutorial%20Photos/THeTitleBar.jpg?t=1255029726

  *  Back Button
To the far left, clicking on this button always goes back to the previous page/view. 

  *  Selected status
In the center the name of the current object selected, if no object is selected it will display "Selected now: Overall".

  *  Help Button
The help button which appears on all windows brings up a menu which gives the user an option to browse the user manual, search for a topic in the manual, or to report a bug. Clicking on the help button again or clicking on "Back" returns to the previous screen.

===The Control Bar===
The control bar is present whenever the user is viewing a machine.  It is displayed at the bottom of the screen and contains 4 clickable buttons:

http://i875.photobucket.com/albums/ab318/greg1337Steff/TheControlBar.jpg?t=1255027176

  *  Undo - Undo previous drag and drop action. I.e. Undoes the last manipulation of the Machine. That is it will return the most recently moved part to its last position.
  *  Details and Discuss - Brings up a screen which shows the details and comments of a particular part (when a part is selected) or the machine in general. Has an option to allow users to add a comment. If this screen is already open, clicking it closes the comment window (returning the machine view). Each Comment will contain the following information:  Posters name, date posted, and the comment itself.  The first comment will always be a detailed description of the part/machine. This description will be made by the machine designer. The rest of the comments are user-created and will be updated from the central server and displayed. If no internet connection is found, then new posts will not be uploaded or downloaded. 
  *  Photos - The button brings up a photo album with relevant photos for the currently selected part. If no part is selected then it brings up a photo album with relevant photos of the overall machine. Clicking on a photo expands the photo to the size of the screen. Zooming in and out of the photo is done by placing two fingers on the screen and separating and pinching the fingers. Dragging a single finger around moves the image around on the screen. There is an option to upload a picture from the iPhone's library or to take a new photo. Clicking on this button shows a menu where the user can select the source of photo. After uploading a photo, the photo appears in the library. 
  *  Reset Button - The reset button returns all the parts of the machine to their original default location. This feature can be supplemented turning on the "Shake to reset" option under "Settings"

==Available actions while in the Machine View==
The Machine view is the screen where the user may view and interact with the machine. It is here that the user may dissasemble the Machine or perform other actions.

===Disassembly===
  *  By using their fingers, users can take a machine, apart piece by piece. Using a "click-and-drag" interface, users can place the pieces anywhere they wish on the screen. Since the machine is built with many overlapping images, users can view the deeper components by dragging the upper images to other places on the screen.  <br> 
  *  In addition to viewing the deeper image, users can drag to zoom to a specific component they want to look at in detail.

  *  To select a part: The user taps the part with their finger.  The name of the part is displayed at the top of the screen to show that the correct part has been selected. The selected part is highlighted with a glowing red 'halo' around it.

  *  To deselect a part:  The user taps on an empty space somewhere on the screen. The red 'halo' disappears and the title bar updates to show that the overall machine is now selected. If the user taps on a different part, then the halo disappears from the old part and appears on the new one. The title bar, as usual, reflects this change as well. 

  *  To move a part:  Once the part is selected the user may press and move their finger around to simulate a dragging action. The part is dragged to the desired location, and releasing the finger stops the dragging motion. 

  *  Zooming: Using two fingers to tap and expand on the screen will zoom in to the machine. To be more precisely, the screen will start zooming in from the place where the two fingers tapped at beginning. So the users can decide where to zoom in. When looking at photos, the action zooms into/out of photos.

  *  Usage of buttons on the control bar, already described above.

==The Comments Page==
===The Interface===
http://virtual-mechanic.googlecode.com/files/Comment_2.jpg
===Viewing Comments===

The comments page is a page that provides you with a list of up to 5 comments on the part that you have selected, or if you have no part selected then the comments are on the machine itself.<br>

- The first comment is saved onto the device and is a comment made by the creator of the machine which gives a basic description of the part, and includes only the comment itself.<br>

http://i875.photobucket.com/albums/ab318/greg1337Steff/Tutorial%20Photos/CommentFormat.jpg?t=1255032153

- The following (up to) 4 comments are posted by users and include: date posted, username, and the comment made by the user.  These comments are loaded from the server and if no connection may be achieved will instead be replaced by the comment: Could not connect to the server.<br>

- If the comments need more space than offered on the screen then, there will be a scroll bar displayed to the right of the screen.<br>

- The option to post a comment will be offered at the bottom of the screen

==The Photo Page==
===The Interface===
http://i875.photobucket.com/albums/ab318/greg1337Steff/Tutorial%20Photos/Photos.jpg?t=1255043665

===Posting or Viewing photos===
To view a larger version of the image of one of the photos simply click it in the photo screen and you will be redirected to a page with the title bar (containing the back 
button, part name, and help button) and the larger version of the image. In this view, the user can zoom and drag the picture around with finger pinching and dragging respectively.

Dragging peace and zooming in the image should perform immediately after users giving the order. Remaining time should be shown on the screen while Uploading comments. 

==== Space Requirements ====
The goal here is to use as little iPhone memory as possible. Comments and picture files will be stored on the server, along with the downloadable content (i.e. Machines). Users will have complete control over how many machines are stored on their iPhone. (I think this is what is meant by space requirement -Marc)

The machine should fit the whole screen on Iphone when the program just started or when users press reset. After zooming in, the images do not have to fit the screen anymore. In the memory part, each part has at most 10 comments including Date, Name(10 characters), comment(200 characters). For the size of pictures, it depends on how many parts the machine has.  

=== Reliability Requirements ===
While running this application, the system will not crash if users follows the safety requirements. If users cannot put the images into their original positions, pressing the reset button will place all images back at their origin position.  

=== Portability Requirements ===
The average time needed to port the application from Mac OSX Operation System to Iphone must not exceeds 1 minutes.

Porting the application from Mac OSX to Iphone must not require modifying more than 0.5% of the modules.

== Organizational Requirements ==
Each machine has as many part of images as possible. The machine's name and images' name has maximum of 20 characters. Each images has maximum 10 comments and each comments has maximum 200 characters. Each users name has maximum 20 characters. Uploading image and comments requires date.

=== Delivery Requirements ===
This application requires the application (.h files, .m files,etc). Also all the data, including images and comments, of the machine must be delivered into iPhone to run this application successfully. 

=== Implementation Requirement ===
The software will be developed using the XCode Interface Builder. The system will be programmed using the Objective-C programming language and will run on the iPhone platform. Operating system is Mac OS.

Then, in this tutorial, we choose the personal computer as an example. Click the personal computer , the screen will show the picture in step3.

*STEP3 - See the comments and description of the part of machine* 

[http://i875.photobucket.com/albums/ab318/greg1337Steff/Tutorial%20Photos/TheMachineView.jpg]

Once we click the personal computer, the whole machine will shown on the screen like the picture above. And  now we can drag any part of the machine to anywhere in the screen. In this example, we choose the DVD driver. We can drag the DVD driver to the up left corner like the picture shown below.

[http://i875.photobucket.com/albums/ab318/greg1337Steff/ChensTut/Open__Drag1.jpg]

Or we can put it into the original place.

[http://i875.photobucket.com/albums/ab318/greg1337Steff/ChensTut/TheMachineView.jpg]

Now we can see and analyze the whole machine. In the next step we want to see the comments, by choosing one part of the machine which the user wants see the information about (in this example we choose the DVD driver)and clicking on the Detail & discuss button The screen will show the following picture.

[http://i875.photobucket.com/albums/ab318/greg1337Steff/Tutorial%20Photos/CommentingInterface.jpg]

*Step4 - Adding our comments of the part of machine *

[http://i875.photobucket.com/albums/ab318/greg1337Steff/Tutorial%20Photos/CommentsPage.jpg]

We want to add our comments of the part of machine so we can press the button called "Post new Comments"

[http://i875.photobucket.com/albums/ab318/greg1337Steff/ChensTut/CommentingInterface.jpg]

Then the keyboard and the comments text field will appear after pressing the "Post new Comments" button as the picture show below.

[http://i875.photobucket.com/albums/ab318/greg1337Steff/ChensTut/Comment_Post.jpg]

In this example we type the question that is shown on the picture, after that we can press the "post" then the comments will be posted on the comments where others could see. We do not have to type user name every time we posting comments, because the user id or password are already memorized once we typed in the beginning of application.
