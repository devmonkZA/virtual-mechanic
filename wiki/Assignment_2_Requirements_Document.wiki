The "Virtual Mechanic" app for iPhone is a teaching tool that allows users to learn about how things work by virtually dissecting machines on the device's touchscreen. The developers of the program will provide content by creating various virtual machines for users to play with. For each machine, the user is basically presented with many layered images that can be selected and dragged around to reveal other images below and around them.

When presented with a machine, users can click and drag parts of the machine around on the screen so that it feels like the user is actually dismantling the machine. Users can find out more about what each part does by reading the part description, viewing other people's comments, and seeing relevant photos.

Users can contribute to the overall discussion by posting photos that are taken by the iPhone. They can also post comments on a specific part of the machine or the machine in general.

=Intended Audience=

==User Groups==
The application is quite general and may apply to almost any sort of mechanical device one can imagine: Computers, cars, boats, clocks, etc. The user groups are expected to have particular interest in performing their learning in a social setting. Users require no more than a basic understanding of how to operate an iPhone. The groups may be categorized as follows:

- Students learning about mechanical devices. <br>
- People working in the field maintaining mechanical devices. <br>
- People interested in developing mechanical devices. <br>
- People who enjoy learning about mechanical devices as a hobby. <br>

==User Requirements==

- The application is completely visual and thus is unavailable to the visually-impaired. <br>
- The users must have access to an iPhone, iTunes with internet access. <br>
- In order to view comments, or download new content the user must have access to the internet. <br>
- Because the application is so heavily text based the user should also have an intermediate understanding of the English language. <br>

=Features=

==Main Menu==
The main menu shall show the logo, and name of the product, the version number, as well as 3 buttons at the bottom of the screen, which offer the following options:

===Start===
Allows the user to load a machine which is already on the device, together with all relevant details, comments and photos. Includes an option to jump to "Download Machines" below. 

===Download Machines===
Shows a catalog of machines available for download. Allows the user to download new machines from the server, together with all relevant details, comments and photos. 

===Settings===
  *  Shake to reset on/off - Toggles option to reset all part locations for a particular machine by shaking the iPhone rigorously. 
  *  Auto update on/off - Toggles option to update current machines on device automatically.
  *  Save on exit - Toggles option to save part positions automatically on exit. 
  *  Background color - Lets users set background color while in machine view.

==Machine View==

===The Control Bar===
The control bar is present whenever the user is viewing a machine.  It is displayed at the bottom of the screen and contains 4 clickable buttons:

  *  Undo - Undo previous drag and drop action
  *  Details and Discuss - Brings up a screen which shows the details and comments of a particular part (when a part is selected) or the machine in general. Has an option to allow users to add a comment. If this screen is already open, clicking it closes the comment window (returning the machine view). Each Comment will contain the following information:  Posters name, date posted, and the comment itself.  The first comment will always be a detailed description of the part/machine. This description will be made by the machine designer. The rest of the comments are user-created and will be updated from the central server and displayed. If no internet connection is found, then new posts will not be uploaded or downloaded. 
  *  Photos - The button brings up a photo album with relevant photos for the currently selected part. If no part is selected then it brings up a photo album with relevant photos of the overall machine. Clicking on a photo expands the photo to the size of the screen. Zooming in and out of the photo is done by placing two fingers on the screen and separating and pinching the fingers. Dragging a single finger around moves the image around on the screen. There is an option to upload a picture from the iPhone's library or to take a new photo. Clicking on this button shows a menu where the user can select the source of photo. After uploading a photo, the photo appears in the library. 
  *  Reset Button - The reset button returns all the parts of the machine to their original default location. This feature can be supplemented turning on the "Shake to reset" option under "Settings"


===Help Button===
The help button which appears on all windows brings up a menu which gives the user an option to browse the user manual, search for a topic in the manual, or to report a bug. Clicking on the help button again or clicking on "Back" returns to the previous screen.

===Back Button===
Clicking on this button always goes back to the previous page/view. 

==Available actions while in the Machine View==
The Machine view is the screen where the user may view and interact with the machine.

===Disassembly===
  *  By using their fingers, users can take a machine, apart piece by piece. Using a "click-and-drag" interface, users can place the pieces anywhere they wish on the screen. Since the machine is built with many overlapping images, users can view the deeper components by dragging the upper images to other places on the screen.  <br> 
  *  In addition to viewing the deeper image, users can drag to zoom to a specific component they want to look at in detail.

  *  To select a part: The user taps the part with their finger.  The name of the part is displayed at the top of the screen to show that the correct part has been selected. The selected part is highlighted with a glowing red 'halo' around it.

  *  To deselect a part:  The user taps on an empty space somewhere on the screen. The red 'halo' disappears and the title bar updates to show that the overall machine is now selected. If the user taps on a different part, then the halo disappears from the old part and appears on the new one. The title bar, as usual, reflects this change as well. 

  *  To move a part:  Once the part is selected the user may press and move their finger around to simulate a dragging action. The part is dragged to the desired location, and releasing the finger stops the dragging motion. 

  *  Zooming
Using two fingers to tap and expand on the screen will zoom in to the machine. To be more precisely, the screen will start zooming in from the place where the two fingers tapped at beginning. So the users can decide where to zoom in. When looking at photos, the action zooms into/out of photos.

  *  Usage of buttons on the control bar, as described above.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
===The Photo page===  
The photo page replaces the view of the machine leaving visible the control bar and the name of the part at the top of the screen.  The photo page will display a list of entries separated by horizontal rules each containing: A picture, a user name, date posted, and a comment.  All of the photo entries shall be loaded from the server and if no connection to the server may be achieved then a single entry shall be displayed on the page containing a comment stating: Could not connect to server
====Close Photos (On the Control Bar)====
The user will be able to close the comments page by again clicking the Photo button.
====Post Reply Button====
The option to post a rely will be given after the last post on that part, the post reply button centered after the last post.
====Help Button (On the Control Bar)====
The help button on this screen brings up a help window which describes the Photo page, and all functions available to the user here.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
==Search==
A button in the main menu links to a search page. Here, users can type the key word in search engine to search for a part which will show on the screen in Iphone and find part descriptions, comments from others, photos, etc.
