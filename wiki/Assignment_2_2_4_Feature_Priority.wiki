#summary Version release for features

4.  Feature Priority You will be going through three implementation iterations during
the course of this project --- version 1, version 2, and version 3. Label each feature
listed in your user manual, as being delivered in version 1, 2, or 3. Hint: An ordered
list of hyperlinks to the relevant features in the user manual might be a good way to
organize this.
 
Remember that your Project planning document from the previous assignment should have a
similar (but less detailed) list of what features are planned for each version; so that would be
a good starting point.
 
It is important that version 1 (and, of course, each following version) be a usable system.
Version 1 should implement all your promised version 1 features completely and correctly!
Also keep in mind that version 3 is the final "gold" version of your project, and anything not
implemented by version 3 will not be implemented at all (at least during this course!).
 
Think hard about a good ordering for your features, taking into account things like their
dependencies, usefulness, and complexity. Do not over-promise (too many features) or
under-deliver (too few features).
