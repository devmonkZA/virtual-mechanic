=Project Plan=

==Introduction==

The goal of the project is to create a flexible image layering system for the iTouch,  platform, that will allow instructors to create a virtual representation of whatever mechanical device they are teaching about.  The user will be able to select a component of the device, and for that component:  Read some information about the component, read other user comments about the component, post their own comments about the component, or drag the component to the side of the screen possibly exposing other components of the device.
