*Project Plan

    What we propose to do is create a piece-by-piece walkthrough of a generic PC build. It will feature examination of the different layers and components involved and the capabilities and functions of each. This application will be used on the iPhone platform and programmed using the Objective C programming language.
    This program is not meant to be exclusive, rather, anyone with an iPhone will be able to use it. Users will start off presented with an image of a PC as it would look fully assembled (i.e. A computer tower and monitor). Users may either choose a component to read/ask/write about or 'zoom in' on the computer to the next layer of components. From this point they may zoom further or zoom out to the previous layer. There will be an online function as well where users will be able to leave notes and questions about various parts in a forum-type discussion board. Also, the users needing further information not discussable through text alone will also be able to post small pictures of the component in question to further clarify what they are trying to say.


<h1><a name="Vision_and_Scope"/>Vision and Scope</h1><p><h3>Project Manager</h3> <p>Catherine Tan</p> </p><p><h3>Stakeholders</h3> <p>The stakeholders of this project will include every member in this group, as well as the professor, Herbert Tsang, and TA, Chen Dai, who will provide us with feedback on our project to aid the success of this project.</p> </p><p><h3> Project Background </h3> <p>Music visualization software is used today in various media applications such as Windows Media Player, iTunes and Winamp. This type of software works by analyzing audio files and extracting quantifiable properties such as the audio’s pitch, loudness and tempo. An audio file’s properties are typically analyzed in this manner to dynamically display various visually aesthetic patterns as the audio file plays. In a matter of speaking, visualization software can be used to visualize a sound file.</p> </p><p><p>This application uses visualization software against audio files provided by the user to create a unique gaming experience that is affected by the user’s choice of music. The game involves an environment in which the user guides a ship though a track and tries to score points while listening to a song. The gameplay will be heavily influenced on the song provided.</p> </p><p><table> <blockquote><tr>
