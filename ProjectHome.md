The software will let users disassemble and analyze machines in virtual reality, to help them learn how things work. It will be similar to existing medical software that lets students explore human anatomy in 3D-MRI models. We define machines here as everyday things such as computers, musical instruments, televisions, watches, cars, planes, etc.

The user can comment on each part of a machine, ask questions, share comments and upload relevant photos.
