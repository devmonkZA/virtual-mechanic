5.  The software tool(s) you are using to measure the size and complexity of your project.
You should be automatically counting various software metrics such as number of
files, number of lines of codes, number of classes, etc.

In addition to providing the raw measurement values, graph this measurement data
(e.g. as line-graphs using an Excel spreadsheet) for each version of your project.
Clearly label your data and graphs so that someone unfamiliar with the details of
your project can understand what it is about without having to look at anything other
than the graph itself.

There are commercial tools that help to measure the size and complexity of your poject. Are you using any?

Graphs scuh as:
version 1: 200 lines of code
version 2: 600 lines of code
version 3: 1500 lines of code
and/or
version 1: 2 classes
version 2: 40 classes
etc.

Remember, this is a evolving document. You may not have all the information at this stage, but you will as we progress though the term. You will also be required to update this document as the project progresses.

I hope this help.
