We need to scramble to pull some stuff together look at this page: http://code.google.com/p/team-ftw/wiki/Assignment1

Also look here: http://webct.sfu.ca/webct/urw/lc827546427031.tp827546448031/RelativeResourceManager/sfsid/893878163011

If the second link fails to load it Herberts notes about project management from week 2.  Of particular interest is page 15 which outlines the structure of a project plan (which we need to hand in tomorow).

I am free all day tomorow untill class.  Tonight I shall start working on the risk analysis and version planning.

So here is the list:


-Intro (our product description)  DONE

-Project Organization  (Any idea what he means here?)

-Risk analysis  (I've got this)

-Hardware and software resource requirements
(I suppose we list any software/hardware used in the developement process? ex: ms project)

-Work breakdown  (list who we've assigned what jobs to)

-Project schedule  (Gantt Chart??  If so DONE!)

-Monitoring and reporting mechanisms
(I think this section should be pretty simple just mention that error reports will be sent to the server where they shall be logged)
